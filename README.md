# WalkingTour

This android app uses Google Maps Activity, Google Location Services, Location Listener, Geocoding,
Geofencing, Full-screen, Custom Fonts

- This app is your own personal walking tour guide for an extensive number of Chicago's famous
architectural "must-see" buildings such as Aqua Tower, Willis Tower, Chicago Theatre, or Rookery Building.
Use this self-guided walking tour to explore the most famous constructions of the Loop District, Chicago.
- The Walking Tours app notifies the user of nearby architectural wonders when they are near the building
location. Tapping on a notification displays information such as a photo of the building, the building name,
address, and a description of its architectural significance.
- This app uses a Google Maps Activity to display a map showing the tour’s path, the user’s nearby
surroundings, the Geofence ranges, and to track and display their movement as they proceed on their
tour.

- The user’s live location is used to update their map position.
- The Google Maps Activity will make use of location data provided continuously by a Location Listener to
determine the user’s current location and to plot their location on the map.
- The map continuously centers itself on the user’s current location. The current location is shown via an
icon that is oriented to show the users direction of travel. Their path on the map is displayed as a solid
line that marks where they have been.
- Geofences are loaded from a cloud-based source so they can change and update without requiring app
updates (http://www.christopherhield.com/data/WalkingTourContent.json). As the user moves, they are
alerted if they enter the range of any of the Geofences.
- The architectural information offered to the user can be viewed by tapping on the Walking Tours
notifications that will appear in the notification bar. Multiple notifications may be present if the user
crosses several Geofence boundaries.
- Walking Tours notification content includes the name of the building, a photo of the building, the
address, and a detailed description of its architectural significance.
- When the app is stopped, the Walking Tours notifications should be removed.
- When the app is started, no history of previously displayed notifications or any previous route path
should be display
